        Given the following information, generate a goal for the user with multiple tasks:
        - Last 3 chats (provide context for interests, goals, and activities):
        ${JSON.stringify(lastChats)}
        - Completed tasks (provide insight into tasks that have already been finished by the user):
        ${JSON.stringify(completedTasks)}
        - User interests (provide a list of activities or hobbies the user enjoys):
        ${JSON.stringify(interests)}

        The goal should include:
        - Title: A concise name for the goal.
        - Description: A detailed explanation of why this goal matters for the user.
        - rewards: {stars, coins}
        - Type: Specify if the goal is personal or family.
        - If **family**, make sure that the goal and tasks involve all family members. The tasks should require collaboration and should be engaging for all ages within the family.
        - If **personal**, create tasks that are focused on the individual's growth and self-improvement.

        For **family** goals:
        - The tasks should be collaborative and designed for family involvement. Tasks should be achievable together, such as family games, outdoor activities, or learning challenges.
        - Each task should be engaging and require the participation of multiple family members.
        - Tasks can include rewards that will motivate everyone in the family to contribute.

        For **personal** goals:
        - Tasks should focus on the individual userâ€™s growth, such as personal development, learning, fitness, or hobbies.
        - Each task should be clear, focused, and motivating for the individual user.

        Each task should have:
        - Title: Short and motivational.
        - Description: Detailed but concise.
        - Rewards: Stars (default: 2) and coins (default: 1).
        - Type: Specify if it's "personal" or "family".
        - Status: All tasks start as incomplete.
